## Contributions

There are two near-identical paths to becoming a contributor. 

1. If you ask Detlev nicely he will add you as a contributor to the repo, which will let you create branches and pull requests. Pull requests will require at least one reviewer to approve before they can be merged into the master branch. This is the easiest way to contribute.
2. If you want to make changes NOW and then ask Detlev later, then you can fork the repo, make the changes in your forked copy, then raise a pull request back over in this repo. It works exactly the same at the end of the day, except that you had to fork the repo.

In both cases, you only need to make changes to the Rmd files. When a change is merged onto the master branch, the book will be recompiled via Travis CI and published to the website automatically. Travis automatically builds and checks your pull requests too, and won't let you merge if you've made a change that will break the book.

These instructions will be fleshed out by Perry at some point - chat to Perry on Slack if you want more guidance in the interim.
