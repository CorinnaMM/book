MDSI is a ‘boutique degree’ which means we are a small tight-knit data family which means the contacts you walk out (really) knowing are going to be more valuable than the skills you learn. In terms of content, our point of difference is the innovation in our name. We take our innovation component as seriously as data science, and is ingrained in everything that’s taught. For us, a data science degree was our innovation (we were the first of its kind in Australia), and in the rapidly changing context that is data, the ability to innovate and adapt is a pretty great point of difference for you too. Data science is a collaborative discipline. Students in the MDSI program get hands on experience of working in teams to formulate and solve real-life data science problems. Most courses focus on techniques to solve problems, but spend very little time (if any) on how problems should be formulated. The MDSI program is structured in a way that helps students learn this tacit, but crucial skill. Another important aspect of data science is that it is a rapidly evolving field. A data scientist must therefore be able to stay current with developments in the field. The MDSI program, with its emphasis on critical self-learning, prepares students to be lifelong learners. Welcome, and good luck on your MDSI journey 1.1 Checklist of things to do Getting started on your MDSI journey can be somewhat overwhelming. So to help you ease into life as an MDSI student, the following checklist will help you to get up and running as painlessly as possible.

What is ethical when it comes to data and the internet of things? Is privacy having a login or not being identifiable as an individual? The world of Ethics and Privacy is changing, similar to the definition that now includes much more than it did a decade ago. Computer security like a login is no longer sufficient to providing protection of privacy which is more focused on ensuring that only people who should have the authority to access your information should be able to. Current Privacy legislation addresses control and authentication processes of whom can access your information via direct disclosures and how this information should be stored by the party who is collecting this information, it does not address disclosures that can be made based on inferences that can be drawn from big data of which your information is a part. Is the value or conclusions that could be drawn from information as part of big data considered private information? A sensible framework in relation to Ethics and Privacy where data is concerned is highlighted in the Belmont report which identifies two rules to consider “(1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms.” A big ethical dilema of late is the rich data sources that various provider hold, that if pooled together will strip all possibility of anonymity.

It can be the time and phone number of someone that you called, the mobile phone tower that you were connected to at the time of making the call and how long you spoke for. It is the IP address of your computer when you connect to the internet. It is the list of items you pay for when you go through the checkout at the supermarket and the eftpos card number you used to pay for the items. It is the surveillance footage you appear in when you move through monitored public spaces. It is stories you ‘like’ or share on social media sites. It is the journeys that your GPS navigation stores about your travels. It is every email you send and every click you make when you browse the internet. Your digital footprint is the inescapable record of your existence by doing nothing more than living your life. It is an important aspect of modern society as many services that you enjoy depend on the data you generate in order to provide critical services. A bank can’t tell you how much money you have without keeping record of your bank transactions. For good or for evil, this data comes embedded with far more information about you. By looking at the kinds of things you spend your money on or the businesses that you spend your money at and the time of day that you spend your money there, it can be determined where you live and where you work. As an MDSI student, you will learn to think critically and ethically about data collection and how it can be used for good and for evil. The best place to start your thinking is with your own digital footprint, become aware of how big it is and how you feel about it. It’s important to note that very little permission is sought on data collection and when it is sought, very little education is provided in terms of the use of that data. Very few providers who collect data clarify or specify what the data they collect is used for. You are responsible for your digital footprint. Generate it wisely. 2.5 Opportunity for overseas exchange Some great opportunities exist within MDSI with our Program Director having many contacts in many other countries which enable us to be able to explore greater opportunities for overseas exchange. You need to do a few things before this opportunity is explored as set out by the Program Director to ensure for an easier way forward if this is an opportunity you want to explore. 2.6 Electives You need to select four electives during your MDSI course. These electives should be selected to assist you in your growth as a student and as a data science professional. These subjects enable you to add to your toolbox of where you are heading with your journey. Electives can be selected from any school however you will still be subjected to the pre-requisites for any possible subject, so it will depend on the requirements of the subject. We suggest that when you apply for a subject with a prerequisite that you also apply for a waive of the prerequisite if the prerequisite is a subject you are familiar with but have not done with UTS and get exemption for that requisite. This is not always easy, or approved and is subject to each School’s internal views or policies. It is definitely a consideration to take. You can apply for the subject ( and a waiver of prerequisites if required) early as CIC is not limited by inter-faculty time restrictions. Our best tip is : get in early. "],
