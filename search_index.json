MDSI is a ‘boutique degree’ which means we are a small tight-knit data family which means the contacts you walk out (really) knowing are going to be more valuable than the skills you learn. In terms of content, our point of difference is the innovation in our name. We take our innovation component as seriously as data science, and is ingrained in everything that’s taught. For us, a data science degree was our innovation (we were the first of its kind in Australia), and in the rapidly changing context that is data, the ability to innovate and adapt is a pretty great point of difference for you too. Data science is a collaborative discipline. Students in the MDSI program get hands on experience of working in teams to formulate and solve real-life data science problems. Most courses focus on techniques to solve problems, but spend very little time (if any) on how problems should be formulated. The MDSI program is structured in a way that helps students learn this tacit, but crucial skill. Another important aspect of data science is that it is a rapidly evolving field. A data scientist must therefore be able to stay current with developments in the field. The MDSI program, with its emphasis on critical self-learning, prepares students to be lifelong learners. Welcome, and good luck on your MDSI journey 1.2 Checklist of things to do Getting started on your MDSI journey can be somewhat overwhelming.

["the-data-science-mindset.html", "Chapter 2 The data science mindset 2.1 CLARA 2.2 Data Science Professional Competencies 2.3 Ethics and Privacy 2.4 Digital Footprint 2.5 Opportunity for overseas exchange 2.6 Electives", " Chapter 2 The data science mindset 2.1 CLARA Each person has their own learning preferences and habits of mind that shape their response to challenges and learning opportunities. CLARA (Crick LeArning for Resilient Agency) is a tool used to prompt reflection on a multidimensional construct called “Learning Power” with eight dimensions: curiosity, creativity, sense making, belonging, collaboration, hope and optimism, mindful agency and openness to change. The UTS Graduate Attributes have a strong resonance with these dimensions. The CLARA tool is used as part of MDSI activities, aiming to help the students maximise their development results through understanding themselves better, namely with regards to their approach to learning and challenges. The tool is survey-based and provides a profile-style feedback covering each of the following dimensions: Curiosity Wanting to get beneath the surface &amp; find out more Always wondering why and how Creativity Using my intuition &amp; imagination to generate new ideas &amp; knowledge Taking risks &amp; playing with ideas and artefacts to arrive at new solutions Sense making Making connections between what I already know &amp; new information &amp; experience Making meaning by linking my story, my new learning &amp; my purpose Belonging Being part of a learning community at work, at home, in education &amp; in my social networks Knowing I have social resources to draw on when I need them Collaboration Being able to work with others, to collaborate and co-generate new ideas and artefacts Being able to listen and contribute productively to a team Hope and optimism Having the optimism &amp; hope that I can learn &amp; achieve over time Having a growth mindset; believing I can generate my own new knowledge for what I need to achieve Mindful agency Taking responsibility for my own learning over time through defining my purposes, understanding and managing my feelings, Knowing how I go about learning &amp; planning my learning journey carefully Openness to change An emotional orientation of being open &amp; ready to invest in learning, having flexible self-belief, willing to persist &amp; manage any self-doubt A necessary prerequisite for developing resilience in learning Here is an example of an output from CLARA, showing the resulting profile, based on the responses provided in the survey. Learning profiles can change over time, so MDSI conducts two sets of CLARA tests, to allow the students to compare their profile changes and reflect on their development progress. CLARA survey will be organised by MDSI and each student will receive a link and instructions on how to utilise this tool. 2.2 Data Science Professional Competencies Competency can be defined as “effective application of skill, knowledge and abilities to on-the-job-behaviour and capability to perform to job requirements”. MDSI supports the ongoing development professional development efforts and offers a tool that can help the students evaluate their skills and abilities in various domains associated with the data science professional competencies. Students are encouraged to utilise the tool to identify the key competencies associated with their individual career aspirations. For each relevant competency, students evaluate their current competency levels, identify any gaps and use the information to create a set of actions that would form their professional development plan. The competencies model is introduced to students as part of 36100 (Data Science and Innovation) subject through a self-assessment exercise. The competencies are divided into two groups: technical and managerial, describing the following competency (proficiency) levels for each domain: Beginner, Competent, Advanced and Expert. Technical: Mathematics and statistics Programing and scripting languages Databases and data storage Computing systems, platforms, security, integration Data mining Data modelling Analytics, predictive modelling and machine learning Data visualisation Business analysis and interpretation Product development Interpersonal/managerial: Creativity Communication Data strategy Line management Data management and governance Facilitation and presentation Project management Competency levels: Beginner: able to assist and perform simple tasks Competent: able to perform tasks independently Advanced: able to perform complex tasks Expert: able to perform complex transformative, strategic or trans-disciplinary tasks The competencies assessment exercise aims to prompt the students to take a proactive attitude to their professional development efforts and effectively apply their analytical skills, dedication and professionalism in managing their career objectives. The competencies assessment exercise covers the following steps: Evaluate your current competency level for each domain on the list Choose a set of domains (no more than 6) that are relevant to your planned development for this subject, your course and your career goals. Identify the goal competency levels for the selected domains and describe related professional development outcomes that support your assessment Analyse your development outcomes in the context of your career goals and identify the gaps between your current and goal competency levels Develop a set of actions needed to achieve desired level of competencies and bridge the identified gap Provide feedback and suggestions for the improvement of the current list of competencies, descriptions etc. 2.3 Ethics and Privacy Its important to understand that security, privacy and ethics are three different things, although heavily intertwined in the ‘internet of things’. What is ethical when it comes to data and the internet of things? Is privacy having a login or not being identifiable as an individual? The world of Ethics and Privacy is changing, similar to the definition that now includes much more than it did a decade ago. Computer security like a login is no longer sufficient to providing protection of privacy which is more focused on ensuring that only people who should have the authority to access your information should be able to. Current Privacy legislation addresses control and authentication processes of whom can access your information via direct disclosures and how this information should be stored by the party who is collecting this information, it does not address disclosures that can be made based on inferences that can be drawn from big data of which your information is a part. Is the value or conclusions that could be drawn from information as part of big data considered private information? A sensible framework in relation to Ethics and Privacy where data is concerned is highlighted in the Belmont report which identifies two rules to consider “(1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms.” A big ethical dilema of late is the rich data sources that various provider hold, that if pooled together will strip all possibility of anonymity. For more on this read: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08900523.2014.863126?src=recsys http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/N_Kshetri_Big_2014.pdf 2.4 Digital Footprint Your digital footprint https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_footprint is the name given to the data that is recorded about you all day every day. It can be the time and phone number of someone that you called, the mobile phone tower that you were connected to at the time of making the call and how long you spoke for. It is the IP address of your computer when you connect to the internet. It is the list of items you pay for when you go through the checkout at the supermarket and the eftpos card number you used to pay for the items. It is the surveillance footage you appear in when you move through monitored public spaces. It is stories you ‘like’ or share on social media sites. It is the journeys that your GPS navigation stores about your travels. It is every email you send and every click you make when you browse the internet. Your digital footprint is the inescapable record of your existence by doing nothing more than living your life. It is an important aspect of modern society as many services that you enjoy depend on the data you generate in order to provide critical services. A bank can’t tell you how much money you have without keeping record of your bank transactions. For good or for evil, this data comes embedded with far more information about you. By looking at the kinds of things you spend your money on or the businesses that you spend your money at and the time of day that you spend your money there, it can be determined where you live and where you work. As an MDSI student, you will learn to think critically and ethically about data collection and how it can be used for good and for evil. The best place to start your thinking is with your own digital footprint, become aware of how big it is and how you feel about it. It’s important to note that very little permission is sought on data collection and when it is sought, very little education is provided in terms of the use of that data. Very few providers who collect data clarify or specify what the data they collect is used for. You are responsible for your digital footprint. Generate it wisely. 2.5 Opportunity for overseas exchange Some great opportunities exist within MDSI with our Program Director having many contacts in many other countries which enable us to be able to explore greater opportunities for overseas exchange. You need to do a few things before this opportunity is explored as set out by the Program Director to ensure for an easier way forward if this is an opportunity you want to explore. 2.6 Electives You need to select four electives during your MDSI course. These electives should be selected to assist you in your growth as a student and as a data science professional. These subjects enable you to add to your toolbox of where you are heading with your journey. Electives can be selected from any school however you will still be subjected to the pre-requisites for any possible subject, so it will depend on the requirements of the subject. We suggest that when you apply for a subject with a prerequisite that you also apply for a waive of the prerequisite if the prerequisite is a subject you are familiar with but have not done with UTS and get exemption for that requisite. This is not always easy, or approved and is subject to each School’s internal views or policies. It is definitely a consideration to take. You can apply for the subject ( and a waiver of prerequisites if required) early as CIC is not limited by inter-faculty time restrictions. Our best tip is : get in early. "],

RStudio is a software program or ‘Integrated Development Environment’ (IDE) that makes working with the R language ALOT easier. The programming environment is really flexible as it allows you the joy of working in a notebook format, scripting, markdown and publishing your work as a PDF. You will use R in many of your subjects and being able to use it well will give you a serious edge over your classmates and competitors at hackathons. Download and install R &amp; RStudio free Download and install the R language: https://cran.rstudio.com/ Download and install RStudio IDE: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Libraries well worth their weight in gold: tidyverse http://tidyverse.org/ A collection of libraries that make data analysis easier readr http://readr.tidyverse.org/ for reading all kinds of data formats stringr http://stringr.tidyverse.org/ for working with text ggplot2 http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/ for visualising data tidyr http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/ for creating tidy data dplyr https://github.com/hadley/dplyr for manipulating data caret http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html for creating predictive models Bookdown https://bookdown.org/ for creating beautiful documents There are many resources to get you started in doing data science with R. Refer to the resources section for more information. 3.2.2 Tableau Tableau is a tool for visualising data. It is quite powerful in its ability to connect to a variety of data sources both on your computer and through the internet. It is also relatively intuitive to use. As a student you can apply to the company for a free license to their commercial desktop version. https://www.tableau.com/academic/students 3.2.3 Github Github is a fantastic tool to become familiar with. It is a great place to store code, collaborate with others and even host your own website or blog. Github has a really generous collection of free stuff for students. To claim yours head over to: https://education.github.com/pack 3.2.4 Python / Rodeo / Jupyter Notebook Python is a general purpose coding language widely used by the data science community. A great place to start is with Anaconda from Continuum Analytics : https://www.continuum.io/downloads Anaconda comes with a ‘container’ management environment called ‘conda’ and ships with a collection of scientific python libraries that have optimised for fast computation. It is also really helpful to manage your libraries and will let you know if there are incompatibilities between the libraries you are using. This is just the tip of the Anaconda iceberg. Python for data science is commonly used in a notebook format. To this end Jupyter notebooks will become a familiar friend. Fortunately it is included as part of Anaconda. For more info, refer to the resources section. If you prefer an ‘R’ style IDE, then Rodeo by Yhat is for you. https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo If you prefer a traditional IDE, you can get a free license for PyCharm (as well as all their other products) from JetBrains using your student details: https://www.jetbrains.com/student/ Libraries well worth their weight in gold: Numpy http://www.numpy.org/ for working with numerical arrays Scipy https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html for scientific computing with python Matplotlib http://matplotlib.org/ for visualising data Seaborn http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html for statistical visualisation Pandas http://pandas.pydata.org/ for working with data Statsmodels http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html for creating statistical models Scikit-Learn http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ for doing machine learning with python Tensorflow https://www.tensorflow.org/ ‘deep learning’ with python Note: Python comes in two different flavours: 2.7 and 3.x. You can start with either version, but it is worth learning what the subtle differences are (eventually). A couple of blog posts to help you choose between R and Python: R vs Python for Data Science: The Winner is http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/05/r-vs-python-data-science.html R vs Python for Data Science: Summary of Modern Advances https://elitedatascience.com/r-vs-python-for-data-science 3.2.5 KNIME KNIME Analytics Platform is an open source solution that enables quick, fast data driven designs for machine learning. Its a visual tool to learn and use when you need to get the job done quickly (without writing any code) and need to create algorithms quickly but you don’t have the time to learn the mathematics behind the algorithms. Its friendly and easy to use to find the hidden ‘story’ in the data. Go to https://www.knime.org/knime-analytics-platform to download KNIME for free. 3.2.6 Rapidminer Rapidminer is another visual tool for doing data analysis, modelling and machine learning.

Google Apps access does not include Gmail. You can not login to your UTS google apps account via gmail or if you are already logged in with a personal gmail account, you will need to log out completely from gmail. Once you have done this, you can log in using your student email address. This will revert you to a UTS login page. Use your UTS student number and password and it will revert you back to the Google Drive, but you will be logged into the drive. Similarly you can mimic the same steps for Office 365. 3.2.10 SPARK-Plus SPARK is an acronym for Self and Peer Assessment Review Kit. This tool has been developed to assist with in class activities as well as being able to self and peer assess assignments. Its also one of the few tools that make group assessments/work easier, in particular to marking. Login with your student ID and Password https://uts.sparkplus.com.au/login.php 3.2.11 Review Review is an assessment tool that is used to mark your work, give you feedback about your work and for you to develop a sense of what is expected by marking your own work before it is assessed by teaching staff. Review allows you to see feedback from your lecturer as well as your mark broken down by specific GA/CILO set out by your assignment. It also allows you to self assess your assignment, which allows the lecturer to see if your expectation is in line with their expectation. It’s important to note that the lecturer will not be able to see your self assessment until after they have saved your mark. You are also able to see the average of the class as well as where the staff has measure you. https://uts.review-edu.com/uts/ 3.3 Writing 3.3.1 Blogs More and more academics and workplaces use blog posts to reach clients, audiences and share knowledge. Blogs can be useful for many reasons and is used as a reflective tool for students as well as providing an opportunity to share any learning. You can use some tools to turn topics into amazing titles by using keyword suggesters (http://keywordtool.io), title generators ( https://www.portent.com/tools/title-maker), and you can also test your headlines with the following tool (http://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer#) Tips for new bloggers Use an eye catching title In-text links Use pictures, pictures speak a thousand words Keep post to 1000-1500 words Use social sharing buttons Use paragraphs - one idea per paragraph Revise and Rewrite Omit needless words - Use the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) Principle Use definite, specific concrete language - direct and to the point Write in a way that comes naturally - use your active voice Be clear - make it simple to read and understand Avoid fancy words Do not take shortcuts at the cost of clarity Tips on writing blog posts : https://problogger.com/how-to-write-great-blog-content/ and http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/26-tips-for-writing-great-blog-posts/ 3.3.2 White papers Where do you start with a white paper and what are they? White papers are originally documents written for government policies however this is most recently being used by companies and universities to get new policies and research into the public space. There are some things to consider when writing a white paper: Pick a topic people will want to read or a problem you want to solve Pick a generic title that describes the problem at hand Engage, inform and convince your reader Be descriptive and professional Consider the audience you are ‘speaking’ to and accommodate for their level of expertise Set up a great intro Emphasize the value you want to or will create Decide on a length for the white paper (1-5 pages are the norm) Describe the solution you are proposing Remember a summary that reviews the problem, solution and result of the outcome Proofread your document, and ensure someone else reads it before you submit/publish it. Follow the 3-30-3 rule ( you have three seconds to captures your audience’s attention from a glance at your piece, if you succeed at capturing their attention then you have 30 more seconds to ensure they continue reading, if you pass the 3-30 rules then your reader will give you three more minutes to make your point). If you would like to enhance your academic writing skills, you might be interested in have a look at the Academic Phrase Bank: http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/ 3.3.3 Assessments The majority of your information regarding a subject and the assessments is contained in your subject outline. This is your base document and you should follow it closely. In addition you will get an assignment brief for each assignment you have due. Its is recommended that you review these briefs and that you follow the detailed instructions set out for you. 3.4 Research &amp; Library Access Research is something you will do a lot throughout your studies. There are many contexts that will shape the way you research. For the purposes of finding academic peer reviewed sources, some tips below will likely come in very handy. The Library ( http://www.lib.uts.edu.au) has great resources, workshops and tools that will help you during your education if you choose to utilise them. If you need some help understanding how to use the library, they have produced some short videos to help you get started: http://www.lib.uts.edu.au/headsup The library website has an entire section dedicated to research: http://www.lib.uts.edu.au/research There is also some self paced training modules you can do to help you get the most of what the library can offer for your research. http://www.lib.uts.edu.au/headsup-researchers 3.4.1 Searching the catalogue One of the great things about the library catalogue is that it returns results far beyond the resources held by the library itself. UTS pay subscription fees to many 3rd party resources including journals, publishers and more. The best thing about this is that if you find something that has an online source available, you will likely be able to download a copy to your computer for later reading. As an example, the link below will take you some search results for the term “Data science” and was then filtered to only show ‘online’ resources. http://find.lib.uts.edu.au/search?Ntx=matchallpartial&amp;Ntk=All&amp;N=4294967183&amp;Ntt=data%20science If you click on the ‘Available’ link underneath each resource, it will then offer you the option of launching the electronic resource. 3.4.2 Databases &amp; Articles If you prefer to search specific sources, you can browse the databases section for 3rd party providers. This includes sources that UTS subscriptions that allow you access as a student. Similarly if you wish to focus your search for specific journal articles rather than journals or books, the ‘Articles’ button is a great place to go. 3.4.3 Referencing It is really important that you get used to referencing from the start. UTS uses the Harvard Referencing style. Fortunately there is an interactive referencing guide available through the library to make things easier: http://www.lib.uts.edu.au/help/referencing Make sure to browse through some of the other links at the above link. You might find some other useful tips (tools). 3.4.4 Library events &amp; tours The library team will help you wherever they can. It is recommended that you keep an eye out for all their events on http://www.lib.uts.edu.au/events The following events, particularly for MDSI students, are coming up in the next month and below are links where you can register. MDSI: Data Science Research and Referencing Tue, 14 March, 2017 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM This workshop is a practical introduction to advanced research skills and reference management tools, with a focus on data science. Laptops are recommended but not essential. Participation is open to MDSI students. A concurrent workshop will run if more than 24 participants register for this session. http://www.lib.uts.edu.au/event/609872/mdsi-data-science-research-and-referencing MDSI: Library Tour and Scavenger Hunt Tue, 14 March, 2017 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM An interactive tour (it’s a scavenger hunt) of the UTS Library services and facilities for MDSI students. Meet in the Library foyer. https://www.lib.uts.edu.au/event/609880/mdsi-library-tour-and-scavenger-hunt 3.5 Professional Experience At times Industry will approach CIC for students who might be interested in internships. These are posted by the CIC:MDSI team in CICAround whenever these possibilities comes up. You can find the postings on CICAround (https://ca.uts.edu.au/blog/) 3.6 Data Security Include a security/privacy sub section (must cover concepts of masking, encrypting etc data) Data security is defined as measures that is used to protect digital privacy as to prevent unauthorised access to computers, databases, websites and other digital items. It also protects data from corruption. Data security can include backups, data masking, encryption or even data erasure. Data masking is defined as the process of changing certain part of data so that the structure remains the same but the information itself is changed to protect sensitive information. It ensures that sensitive information is unavailable beyond the permitted environment. It ensures that the original values are not re-engineered or identified. Eg is user training and software testing. Data encryption ensures that data is unreadable to users who are not authorised to access the data and who do not have the ‘key’. One of the most common ways of securing data is using authentication like passwords, and other data that can verify an identity ( like email and password login) prior to granting access to a system. These measures are taken to ensure hackers that use alternative system access methods to sabotage computer systems and networks. Hacker actions can be illegal or legal depending on the purpose behind the actions. There are three categories of hackers : Black hat hackers break into computer systems illegally and cause harm by stealing or destroying data, i.e., a banking system to steal money for personal gain. White hat hackers use their skills to help enterprises create robust computer systems. Grey hat hackers perform illegal hacking activities to show off their skills, rather than to achieve personal gain. 10 General Data Security Tips: Back up early and often Use file-level and share-level security Password protect documents Use EFS encryption Use disk encryption Use a public key infrastructure Hide data Protect data in transit Secure wireless transmission Use management or access control Types of Encryption: Triple DES : It uses three individual keys with 56 bits each that adds up to 168 bits. This is a dependable hardware encryption solution RSA : A public-key encryption algorithm and is standard for encrypting data over the internet. Is a asymmetric algorithm due to use of a pair of keys. There is a public key, to encrypt, and a private key, used to decrypt. Blowfish : the symmetric cipher splits messages into blocks of 64 bits and encrypts them individually. Its high speed and very effective. It’s also free source software. Twofish : Symmetric algorithm with keys up to 256 bits, only one key is needed. The fastest of its kind and ideal for hardware and software. It’s also free source software. AES : Most trusted algorithm by U.S. Government. Has an efficient 128-bit but also a 192 and 256 bit algorithms for heavy duty encryption purposes. Considered impervious to attacks except brute force. Honey Encryption : deters hackers by serving fake data for every incorrect guess. It slows down attackers but also provides a haystack of false hopes and makes it difficult for hackers to find the correct key. http://www.computerworld.com/article/2546352/data-center/top-10-ways-to-secure-your-stored-data.html http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/what-is/data-security.html http://www.lexisnexis.com.au/en-au/products/privacy-confidentiality-and-data-security.page 3.7 Hackathons Hackathons are competitions (socially or sometimes for a prize) that challenge you with a goal or a problem. In a data science context this typically involves datasets and your wits against a clock. Hackathons are a fantastic way to learn from each other, to ideate, validate, develop your skills and sometimes even build a prototype. Hackathons are one of the most authentic learning experiences you can have as a data science student. You will practice all sorts of skills you need to become amazing: Team work How to frame a problem Data investigation Practicing and learning all kinds of technical skills Data storytelling Presentation &amp; selling your ideas Networking Hackathons are educational, engaging and empowering. You do not need to feel ready before you participate. The only thing you need to do is show up, have a positive ‘can do’ attitude and have fun. They last anything from a few hours to a few days. MDSI students have been leaving their mark at these events by taking home the prizes as well as the really big prize checks as can be seen on display in CIC. The most popular one to get involved in is ‘Unearthed’: http://unearthed.solutions/ Our very own ‘Data Cake’ took home the first prize in 2016, ‘Perry’s Fan Club’ took home shared second prize in 2016 as well as ‘Team Beaver’ taking home Young Innovator Award. If you don’t want to wait for an event and want to sink your teeth into a hackathon right now, you can participate in online data science competitions. Here are a few links to get your started: Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/ DrivenData https://www.drivendata.org InnoCentive https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/browse A list of hackathons updated weekly : http://disruptorshandbook.com/big-list-hackathons/ Another good source of hackathons : http://www.hackathonsaustralia.com/ 3.8 Cloud Computing Cloud computing is a phrase used to describe the act of doing things that you could do on your own computer but doing it on a remote computer instead. There several reasons why you might choose to do this. In the context of data science, this is usually to take advantage of ‘compute clusters’. Compute clusters are exactly what it sounds like. A cluster of computer processors are used together to give you the advantage of their combined power which leads to faster data processing. This makes it possible to run analysis routines on large datasets (gigabytes, terabytes or even petabytes) that could take days or weeks to run on your laptop, in mere minutes or hours. There are a few more concepts to understand, but essentially the bottom line is that cloud computing makes things faster and big datasets more accessible from an analysis point of view. There are several providers that operate in this space for data science purposes. Some of these include: Amazon Web Services (AWS) https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/?nc2=h_l3_bh Microsoft Azure https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/ Google Cloud Platform https://cloud.google.com/ Make sure you claim your $100 student credit when you sign up to the Github student pack https://education.github.com/pack 3.9 The art of ‘self learning’ Self learning is the process of teaching ‘self’. With the boom in freely available technology it has become possible for each student to dictate their own learning experience and how much they want to expand. They can either learn the minimum of what is being taught in class, or they can put in extra time and work and participate in the exciting adventure of self learning. This involves using various resources from YouTube, Journals, Additional Books and anything else you can get your hands on that adds to your skillset and your knowledge base. In recent days self learning is considered an art with lecturers there as guidance or mentors on this journey where you can develop your skills to great depth in a short amount of time. There are a few things to keep in mind during this journey : Reputable sources for learning a concept is required. If you plan to embark on the art of self learning you need to make sure that the sources you are learning from, know what they are talking about. What can be considered reputable sources? Academic journals or white papers Non- biased sources Generally, personal blogs are avoided. However, in this constantly updating space we might need to learn from other expert in the field that explain these fast changing concepts. Read textbooks and books about the topic. A large collection of books are available to you as a student for free via the Library (you can sometimes even download a pdf version for your personal use). Watch the videos on YouTube on the topic, especially for the more tricky, hands on or mathematical based subjects. Learn from your surroundings. Never underestimate the value others can bring to your journey. This ranges from mentors to other students, some students are further in their journey and can help you along. There are also various meet-ups and networking events surrounding these topics. Hands-on experience is by far the best. Join a hackathon, or get an internship. Use guided learning experiences, like MOOC’s on Coursera or a range of other platforms. Plan your success. Write down your goals, learning outcomes and what you would like to master or be able to do and endeavour to move toward those goals (this will be really handy in iLab too). 3.10 Resources and learning Online short courses: Lynda.com : you have free membership via the Library which gives you access to all the courses, https://www.lib.uts.edu.au/goto?url=https://shib.lynda.com/Shibboleth.sso/InCommon?providerId=https://aaf-login.uts.edu.au/idp/shibboleth Coursera : membership is free, https://www.coursera.org/ DataCamp : you have free membership via MDSI which gives you access to all the courses, https://www.datacamp.com/, once you join ask to join MDSI group and the courses open up.
