<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Get your subject outlines:</h3>
<p><img src="Images/UTSOnline.png" /><!-- --> MDSI uses a variety of systems for online teaching and learning. UTSOnline and CICAround are the two primary environments for you to familiarise yourself with.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do after activating your email address is to login to UTSOnline, access your subjects and find your subject outline. Your subject outline contains everything you need to know about your subject for the coming semester. It includes the contact information for your subject co-ordinator, important dates, assessment descriptions and much more. In most cases you can find the answer to any question you might have about your subject addressed in the subject outline.</p>
<p><strong>Find your subject outlines in UTSOnline:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Login to UTSOnline at <a href="https://online.uts.edu.au/" class="uri">https://online.uts.edu.au/</a> using your student ID number and the password you setup for your UTS email account.</li>
<li>Access your subjects by clicking on your subject name</li>

<p><img src="Images/CAlogo.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Your next stop should be CICAround. Here you will connect with your peers in an academic capacity. There are discussion forums for your subjects where you can post questions. CICAround most notably is where you will go to blog about your experiences throughout your MDSI journey. The first step is to activate your blog. Then you can browse through the blogs of your new MDSI family and read about their experiences and the things they have learnt.</p>
<p><strong>Activate and personalise your CICAround profile:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to <a href="https://ca.uts.edu.au/using-ca/" class="uri">https://ca.uts.edu.au/using-ca/</a></li>
<li>Watch the welcome video then login to CICAround using your student ID and password.</li>

<p>Slack has proven to be a very useful tool so far. It is completely driven by the student community and is where the MDSI student community goes to socialise, organise BBQs, ask each other for technical help and share useful resources. If you need a quick answer, Slack is the place to go.</p>
<p><strong>Join the Slack Channel</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can download the Slack application from <a href="https://slack.com/downloads" class="uri">https://slack.com/downloads</a></li>
<li>You can also get the app for IOS, Android and Windows phones.</li>
<li>You do not need to pay for a subscription.</li>

<p>Your university account allows you access to Google Apps and Office 365.</p>
<p>Google Apps access does not include Gmail. You can not login to your UTS google apps account via gmail or if you are already logged in with a personal gmail account, you will need to log out completely from gmail. Once you have done this, you can log in using your student email address. This will revert you to a UTS login page. Use your UTS student number and password and it will revert you back to the Google Drive, but you will be logged into the drive.</p>

<p>‘R’ is a coding language used by most of the data science community. RStudio is a software program or ‘Integrated Development Environment’ (IDE) that makes working with the R language ALOT easier. The programming environment is really flexible as it allows you the joy of working in a notebook format, scripting, markdown and publishing your work as a PDF.</p>
<p>You will use R in many of your subjects and being able to use it well will give you a serious edge over your classmates and competitors at hackathons.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Python / Rodeo / Jupyter Notebook</h3>
<p><img src="Images/Pythonlogo.png" /><!-- --> <img src="Images/Anacondalogo.png" /><!-- --></p>
<p>Python is a general purpose coding language widely used by the data science community. A great place to start is with Anaconda from Continuum Analytics : <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads" class="uri">https://www.continuum.io/downloads</a></p>
<p>Anaconda comes with a ‘container’ management environment called ‘conda’ and ships with a collection of scientific python libraries that have optimised for fast computation. It is also really helpful to manage your libraries and will let you know if there are incompatibilities between the libraries you are using. This is just the tip of the Anaconda iceberg.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Jupyterlogo.png" width="20%" /></p>
<p>Python for data science is commonly used in a notebook format. To this end Jupyter notebooks will become a familiar friend. Fortunately it is included as part of Anaconda. For more info, refer to the resources section.</p>
<p><img src="Images/Rodeologo.png" width="20%" /></p>
<p>If you prefer an ‘R’ style IDE, then Rodeo by Yhat is for you. <a href="https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo" class="uri">https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo</a></p>
<p>If you prefer a traditional IDE, you can get a free license for PyCharm (as well as all their other products) from JetBrains using your student details: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/student/" class="uri">https://www.jetbrains.com/student/</a></p>

<div id="white-papers" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> White papers</h3>
<p>Where do you start with a white paper and what are they? White papers are originally documents written for government policies however this is most recently being used by companies and universities to get new policies and research into the public space.</p>
<p>There are some things to consider when writing a white paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a topic people will want to read or a problem you want to solve</li>
<li>Pick a generic title that describes the problem at hand</li>
<li>Engage, inform and convince your reader</li>
<li>Be descriptive and professional</li>
<li>Consider the audience you are ‘speaking’ to and accommodate for their level of expertise</li>
<li>Set up a great intro</li>
<li>Emphasize the value you want to or will create</li>
<li>Decide on a length for the white paper (1-5 pages are the norm)</li>
<li>Describe the solution you are proposing</li>
<li>Remember a summary that reviews the problem, solution and result of the outcome</li>
<li>Proofread your document, and ensure someone else reads it before you submit/publish it.</li>
<li>Follow the 3-30-3 rule ( you have three seconds to captures your audience’s attention from a glance at your piece, if you succeed at capturing their attention then you have 30 more seconds to ensure they continue reading, if you pass the 3-30 rules then your reader will give you three more minutes to make your point).</li>

<div id="data-security" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Data Security</h2>
<p>include a security/privacy sub section (must cover concepts of masking, encrypting etc data)</p>
<p>Data security is defined as measures that is used to protect digital privacy as to prevent unauthorised access to computers, databases, websites and other digital items. It also protects data from corruption.</p>
<p>Data security can include backups, data masking, encryption or even data erasure.</p>
<p>Data masking is defined as the process of changing certain part of data so that the structure remains the same but the information itself is changed to protect sensitive information. It ensures that sensitive information is unavailable beyond the permitted environment. It ensures that the original values are not re-engineered or identified. Eg is user training and software testing.</p>
<p>Data encryption ensures that data is unreadable to users who are not authorised to access the data and who do not have the ‘key’.</p>
<p>One of the most common ways of securing data is using authentication like passwords, and other data that can verify an identity ( like email and password login) prior to granting access to a system. These measures are taken to ensure hackers that use alternative system access methods to sabotage computer systems and networks.</p>
<p>Hacker actions can be illegal or legal depending on the purpose behind the actions. There are three categories of hackers :</p>
<ul>
<li>Black hat hackers break into computer systems illegally and cause harm by stealing or destroying data, i.e., a banking system to steal money for personal gain.</li>
<li>White hat hackers use their skills to help enterprises create robust computer systems.</li>
<li>Grey hat hackers perform illegal hacking activities to show off their skills, rather than to achieve personal gain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10 General Data Security Tips:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Back up early and often</li>
<li>Use file-level and share-level security</li>
<li>Password protect documents</li>
<li>Use EFS encryption</li>
<li>Use disk encryption</li>
<li>Use a public key infrastructure</li>
<li>Hide data</li>
<li>Protect data in transit</li>
<li>Secure wireless transmission</li>
<li>Use management or access control</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Types of Encryption:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Triple DES : It uses three individual keys with 56 bits each that adds up to 168 bits. This is a dependable hardware encryption solution</li>
<li>RSA : A public-key encryption algorithm and is standard for encrypting data over the internet. Is a asymmetric algorithm due to use of a pair of keys. There is a public key, to encrypt, and a private key, used to decrypt.</li>
<li>Blowfish : the symmetric cipher splits messages into blocks of 64 bits and encrypts them individually. Its high speed and very effective. It’s also free source software.</li>
<li>Twofish : Symmetric algorithm with keys up to 256 bits, only one key is needed. The fastest of its kind and ideal for hardware and software. It’s also free source software.</li>
<li>AES : Most trusted algorithm by U.S. Government. Has an efficient 128-bit but also a 192 and 256 bit algorithms for heavy duty encryption purposes. Considered impervious to attacks except brute force.</li>
<li>Honey Encryption : deters hackers by serving fake data for every incorrect guess. It slows down attackers but also provides a haystack of false hopes and makes it difficult for hackers to find the correct key.</li>

<div id="hackathons" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> Hackathons</h2>
<p>Hackathons are competitions (socially or sometimes for a prize) that challenge you with a goal or a problem. In a data science context this typically involves datasets and your wits against a clock. Hackathons are a fantastic way to learn from each other, to ideate, validate, develop your skills and sometimes even build a prototype. Hackathons are one of the most authentic learning experiences you can have as a data science student. You will practice all sorts of skills you need to become amazing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team work</li>
<li>How to frame a problem</li>
<li>Data investigation</li>
<li>Practicing and learning all kinds of technical skills</li>
<li>Data storytelling</li>
<li>Presentation &amp; selling your ideas</li>
<li>Networking</li>
</ul>
<p>Hackathons are educational, engaging and empowering. You do not need to feel ready before you participate. The only thing you need to do is show up, have a positive ‘can do’ attitude and have fun.</p>
<p>They last anything from a few hours to a few days.</p>
<p>MDSI students have been leaving their mark at these events by taking home the prizes as well as the really big prize checks as can be seen on display in CIC.</p>
<p>The most popular one to get involved in is ‘Unearthed’: <a href="http://unearthed.solutions/" class="uri">http://unearthed.solutions/</a> Our very own ‘Data Cake’ took home the first prize in 2016, ‘Perry’s Fan Club’ took home shared second prize in 2016 as well as ‘Team Beaver’ taking home Young Innovator Award.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to wait for an event and want to sink your teeth into a hackathon right now, you can participate in online data science competitions. Here are a few links to get your started:</p>

<div id="cloud-computing" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.8</span> Cloud Computing</h2>
<p>Cloud computing is a phrase used to describe the act of doing things that you could do on your own computer but doing it on a remote computer instead. There several reasons why you might choose to do this. In the context of data science, this is usually to take advantage of ‘compute clusters’.</p>
<p>Compute clusters are exactly what it sounds like. A cluster of computer processors are used together to give you the advantage of their combined power which leads to faster data processing. This makes it possible to run analysis routines on large datasets (gigabytes, terabytes or even petabytes) that could take days or weeks to run on your laptop, in mere minutes or hours. There are a few more concepts to understand, but essentially the bottom line is that cloud computing makes things faster and big datasets more accessible from an analysis point of view.</p>
<p>There are several providers that operate in this space for data science purposes. Some of these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Web Services (AWS) <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/?nc2=h_l3_bh" class="uri">https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/?nc2=h_l3_bh</a></li>
<li>Microsoft Azure <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/" class="uri">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/</a></li>
<li>Google Cloud Platform <a href="https://cloud.google.com/" class="uri">https://cloud.google.com/</a></li>

<div id="the-art-of-self-learning" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> The art of ‘self learning’</h2>
<p>Self learning is the process of teaching ‘self’. With the boom in freely available technology it has become possible for each student to dictate their own learning experience and how much they want to expand. They can either learn the minimum of what is being taught in class, or they can put in extra time and work and participate in the exciting adventure of self learning.</p>
<p>This involves using various resources from YouTube, Journals, Additional Books and anything else you can get your hands on that adds to your skillset and your knowledge base.</p>
<p>In recent days self learning is considered an art with lecturers there as guidance or mentors on this journey where you can develop your skills to great depth in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind during this journey :</p>
<ul>
<li>Reputable sources for learning a concept is required. If you plan to embark on the art of self learning you need to make sure that the sources you are learning from, know what they are talking about. What can be considered reputable sources?
<ul>
<li>Academic journals or white papers</li>
<li>Non- biased sources</li>
<li>Generally, personal blogs are avoided. However, in this constantly updating space we might need to learn from other expert in the field that explain these fast changing concepts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read textbooks and books about the topic. A large collection of books are available to you as a student for free via the Library (you can sometimes even download a pdf version for your personal use).</li>
<li>Watch the videos on YouTube on the topic, especially for the more tricky, hands on or mathematical based subjects.</li>
<li>Learn from your surroundings. Never underestimate the value others can bring to your journey. This ranges from mentors to other students, some students are further in their journey and can help you along. There are also various meet-ups and networking events surrounding these topics.</li>
<li>Hands-on experience is by far the best. Join a hackathon, or get an internship.</li>
<li>Use guided learning experiences, like MOOC’s on Coursera or a range of other platforms.</li>
<li>Plan your success. Write down your goals, learning outcomes and what you would like to master or be able to do and endeavour to move toward those goals (this will be really handy in iLab too).</li>
