\chapter{Welcome}\label{welcome}

MDSI is unique in its approach and feel. MDSI is a `boutique degree'
which means we are a small tight-knit data family which means the
contacts you walk out (really) knowing are going to be more valuable
than the skills you learn. In terms of content, our point of difference
is the innovation in our name. We take our innovation component as
seriously as data science, and is ingrained in everything that's taught.
For us, a data science degree was our innovation (we were the first of
its kind in Australia), and in the rapidly changing context that is
data, the ability to innovate and adapt is a pretty great point of
difference for you too.

Data science is a collaborative discipline. Students in the MDSI program
get hands on experience of working in teams to formulate and solve
real-life data science problems. Most courses focus on techniques to
solve problems, but spend very little time (if any) on how problems
should be formulated. The MDSI program is structured in a way that helps
students learn this tacit, but crucial skill.

Another important aspect of data science is that it is a rapidly
evolving field. A data scientist must therefore be able to stay current
with developments in the field. The MDSI program, with its emphasis on
critical self-learning, prepares students to be lifelong learners.

Welcome, and good luck on your MDSI journey

\section{Ethics amd Privacy}\label{ethics-amd-privacy}

Its important to understand that security, privacy and ethics are three
different things, although heavily intertwined in the `internet of
things'.

What is ethical when it comes to data and the internet of things? Is
privacy having a login or not being identifiable as an individual?

The world of Ethics and Privacy is changing, similar to the definition
that now includes much more than it did a decade ago. Computer security
like a login is no longer sufficient to providing protection of privacy
which is more focused on ensuring that only people who should have the
authority to access your information should be able to.

Current Privacy legislation addresses control and authentication
processes of whom can access your information via direct disclosures and
how this information should be stored by the party who is collecting
this information, it does not address disclosures that can be made based
on inferences that can be drawn from big data of which your information
is a part. Is the value or conclusions that could be drawn from
information as part of big data considered private information?

A sensible framework in relation to Ethics and Privacy where data is
concerned is highlighted in the Belmont report which identifies two
rules to consider ``(1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits
and minimize possible harms.''

A big ethical dilema of late is the rich data sources that various
provider hold, that if pooled together will strip all possibility of
anonymity.

\section{Digital Footprint}\label{digital-footprint}

Your digital footprint is the name given to the data that is recorded
about you all day every day. It can be the time and phone number of
someone that you called, the mobile phone tower that you were connected
to at the time of making the call and how long you spoke for. It is the
IP address of your computer when you connect to the internet. It is the
list of items you pay for when you go through the checkout at the
supermarket and the eftpos card number you used to pay for the items. It
is the surveillance footage you appear in when you move through
monitored public spaces. It is stories you `like' or share on social
media sites. It is the journeys that your GPS navigation stores about
your travels. It is every email you send and every click you make when
you browse the internet.

Your digital footprint is the inescapable record of your existence by
doing nothing more than living your life. It is an important aspect of
modern society as many services that you enjoy depend on the data you
generate in order to provide critical services. A bank can't tell you
how much money you have without keeping record of your bank
transactions. For good or for evil, this data comes embedded with far
more information about you. By looking at the kinds of things you spend
your money on or the businesses that you spend your money at and the
time of day that you spend your money there, it can be determined where
you live and where you work.

As an MDSI student, you will learn to think critically and ethically
about data collection and how it can be used for good and for evil. The
best place to start your thinking is with your own digital footprint,
become aware of how big it is and how you feel about it.

It's important to note that very little permission is sought on data
collection and when it is sought, very little education is provided in
terms of the use of that data. Very few providers who collect data
clarify or specify what the data they collect is used for.

You are responsible for your digital footprint. Generate it wisely.

\section{Opportunity for overseas
exchange}\label{opportunity-for-overseas-exchange}

Some great opportunities exist within MDSI with our Program Director
having many contacts in many other countries which enable us to be able
to explore greater opportunities for overseas exchange.

You need to do a few things before this opportunity is explored as set
out by the Program Director to ensure for an easier way forward if this
is an opportunity you want to explore.

\section{Electives}\label{electives}

You need to select four electives during your MDSI course. These
electives should be selected to assist you in your growth as a student
and as a data science professional. These subjects enable you to add to
your toolbox of where you are heading with your journey.

Electives can be selected from any school however you will still be
subjected to the pre-requisites for any possible subject, so it will
depend on the requirements of the subject.

We suggest that when you apply for a subject with a prerequisite that
you also apply for a waive of the prerequisite if the prerequisite is a
subject you are familiar with but have not done with UTS and get
exemption for that requisite.

This is not always easy, or approved and is subject to each School's
internal views or policies. It is definitely a consideration to take.

You can apply for the subject ( and a waiver of prerequisites if
required) early as CIC is not limited by inter-faculty time
restrictions.

Our best tip is : get in early.

\section{Technology}\label{technology}

\subsection{Your UTS email:}\label{your-uts-email}

First and foremost you need to activate your UTS email address. All
official communications from UTS, subject notifications, MDSI
newsletters etc will be sent to this email address. You need to activate
your email address before you can access other UTS systems.

\textbf{Activate your UTS Student email:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Navigate to
  \url{https://email.itd.uts.edu.au/webapps/myaccount/activation/} and
  follow the steps to activate your UTS student email account.
\item
  **Pro-\url{tip:**} If you don't want to login frequently to check if
  you have mail, simply setup a email forwarding to an email address of
  your choice via the settings page after logging in.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Get your subject outlines:}\label{get-your-subject-outlines}

MDSI uses a variety of systems for online teaching and learning.
UTSOnline and CICAround are the two primary environments for you to
familiarise yourself with.

The first thing you need to do after activating your email address is to
login to UTSOnline, access your subjects and find your subject outline.
Your subject outline contains everything you need to know about your
subject for the coming semester. It includes the contact information for
your subject co-ordinator, important dates, assessment descriptions and
much more. In most cases you can find the answer to any question you
might have about your subject addressed in the subject outline.

\textbf{Find your subject outlines in UTSOnline:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Login to UTSOnline at \url{https://online.uts.edu.au/} using your
  student ID number and the password you setup for your UTS email
  account.
\item
  Access your subjects by clicking on your subject name
\item
  Download your subject outline by clicking on the link titled `Subject
  Outline' in the left side menu, then click on the subject outline link
  on the page.
\end{itemize}
